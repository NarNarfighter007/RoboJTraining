Interpreted vs. Compiled
	Interpreted --> Line-by-line; write once, run anywhere
		e.g. Python, PHP
		There is an "interpreter" between python code and the processor to convert it (translater)
		It is costly and slow, but easier to implement

	Compiled --> Language is compiled SEPARATELY prior to runtime
		Much quicker, and the "translation" executes once before running
		However, compiled programs only work on the processor compiled on
		e.g. C, C++

Java is BOTH!
	Compiles java programs through javac
	Simple byte code is run through an interpreter (simple math, memory management, etc.)
	Java class file precompiles
	Then java class file is run through a JRE (Java Runtime Enviroment)
	JRE translates the byte code to machine code

Syntax is grammar, spelling, language structure
Semantics is what what the line of code means
